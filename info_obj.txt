Koprivshtitsa is well-known for its historic Bulgarian architecture, folk festivals, and historical landmarks.
Koprivshtitsa represents one of the best-preserved Renaissance towns in the country, reflecting the essence and atmosphere of the Bulgarian Renaissance period. This town's history has an unbreakable connection to the 19th-century uprisings against the Ottoman Empire, which is why it occupies an important place in the hearts of numerous Bulgarians.
The stone bridge of the First Rifle, alongside the house-museums of Dimcho Debelyanov, Lyuben Karavelov, Todor Kableshkov, Georgi Benkovski, and other significant Bulgarian personas and revolutionaries, belong to the most significant attractions in Koprivshtitsa.
